# Awale

from wikipedia:
Awale is an abstract strategy game among the Mancala family of board games (pit and pebble games) played world-wide with slight variations as to the layout of the game, number of players and strategy of play. Its origin is uncertain but is widely believed to be of Akan origin.

Played throughout West Africa and the Caribbean, Oware and its variants have many names - Ayò (Yoruba), Awalé (Côte d'Ivoire), Wari (Mali), Ouri, Ouril or Uril (Cape Verde), Warri (Caribbean), Wali (Dagbani), Adji (Ewe), Nchọ/Ókwè (Igbo), ise (Edo) and Awélé (Ga). A common name in English is Awari but one of the earliest Western scholars to study the game, R.S. Rattray, used the name Wari.
